# JavaScript30 - https://javascript30.com/

## Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and ##working in the DOM without a library.

##You should already know some JavaScript to start - This isn't a JavaScript 101 course. We learn by application - ##encountering many new situations while talking about the hows, the whys and the whats that we use to solve them.

##We steer clear of opinionated design patterns, frameworks, libraries and any type of abstraction. These things are great and ##often needed, but can obstruct learning and constrain initial understanding.

##These tutorials rely heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the page. If you are stuck in ##console.log() land, these videos are your next step. Oh, the stuff we build is really fun!
